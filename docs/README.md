# Legacy Python 2.x Codebase

This project contains a collection of legacy Python 2.x code, which demonstrates outdated practices, including old-style print statements, exception handling, string formatting, and more. The project simulates interactions with a database, file I/O, and data processing that would have been common in Python 2.x applications.

## Features:
1. Old-style print statements without parentheses.
2. Legacy exception handling (`except Exception, e:`).
3. Outdated string formatting using `%` operator.
4. Simulated database interaction and data processing.
5. File reading and writing using Python 2.x methods.

## To run the code:
1. Ensure you're using Python 2.7.x.
2. Run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
